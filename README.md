## Usage

This site accesses an API for a random set of users, but if you provide us with a database of your employees, we could tailor the site to work for your needs.

Start typing in the search field and your employees will be filtered to only include what matches the letters in the search field.

Clicking on any of the field names (with the exception of the **image** column, will allow you to toggle sorting between ascending and descending, depending on whether the data is alphabetized or organized numerically.
